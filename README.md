Instructions to run this code:
1. Install Visual Studio
2. Create a new folder and name it as "To-do App"
3. Open the new terminal which will be top left, beside Run option
4. After the new terminal opens, install the vite by running this code
   " npm create vite@latest"
   This will create a folder named vite-project (generally Vite is a blunder where we can use React.js)
5. After installing the vite-project, enter this line to change directory to vite-project
   " cd vite-project"
6. Now, we have to install packages, so enter this line to install all the node packages into the vite-project
   " npm install"
   This will install the packages into the projects
7. Now, we have to create a folder named "Components" and create all the components in that folder
   (You can see the code, and it quite easy, just compare the manual code and this code and make the changes accordingly)
8. After making all the components and copying the code, enter this line to run the project
   " npm run dev"
   This will provide a link / server, open it and our project appears.
9. Thank you and happy coding
